# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
I created a webpage that takes user input and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to dynamically add information to the page. Specifically, I used asynchronous functions/promises to GET and POST information. This project was very eye-opening for me. Learning how establish a server with node and how to create routes that respond to different requests was fascinating. The most challening aspect of this project was learning the syntax of how to chain promises.
